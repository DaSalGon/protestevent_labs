**Dynamics of Protest Politics. Perspectives from Protest Event Analysis - R Labs**

Winter Semester 2024/2025, 30220 Research seminar by Hutter and Saldivia Gonzatti, FU Berlin.


**Description**:
This Github repository offers the code and data we will use during the course.

**Nov. 25: Lab 3**

In Lab 3, we compare the SCAD dataset with data from the Mass Mobilization Project (https://massmobilization.github.io/). Are both data sets as reliable? Do they show the same contentious dynamics? We will discuss what we should be paying attention to and discuss differences between both data sets.


**Nov. 11: Lab 2**

In Lab 2, we look into protest data from Latin America based on the SCAD dataset (https://www.strausscenter.org/ccaps-research-areas/social-conflict/database/). We will analyse some descriptive statistics and combine the data with the democracy polyarchy indicator by the V-DEM project (https://v-dem.net/). We will analyze the data to get an idea of whether democratization leads to protes!


**Nov. 4: Lab 1**

You will find a simple R script of Laboratory 1 in the scripts folder. Please take a look at it, we will discuss it in the session on November 4. For the analysis, you must download the data from https://poldem.eui.eu/download/, specifically PolDem-30.

**Homework Week 1: Statistical test**

For this homework and the course, you should have installed the statistical program R and its environment-friendly program RStudio. Alternatively, you can use Stata if you have access to it.

You should prepare the answers to the statistical test for the next session in Week 2, on October 28. Send your code answers to Daniel by Monday, October 28, at 10 a.m.
